So, I want to take a course [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor). <br/>
Of course I will need more time than 12 weeks, but I will take the course.
Here I will keep a small account of my progress.

Now I have a small list of languages that I need to learn during the course:
- Verilog
- ะก
- Assembler
- Haskell

Looks really interesting...
hello

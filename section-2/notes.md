# UART in verilog and python

## So, how UART work?
UART - in short, transmitter and reveiver use start bit, stop bit and timing parameters to synchronize with each other.

The UART starts the communication with a start bit '0'. The start bit initiates the transfer of serial data and stop bit ends the data transaction.

This directory contains the sources of GHDL, the open-source analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental) synthesizer forÂ [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL), a Hardware Description Language ([HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language)). GHDL is not an interpreter: it allows you to analyse and elaborate sources for generating machine code from your design. Native program execution is the only way for high-speed simulation.
